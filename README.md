# MechaCar_Statitstical_Analysis_With_R
# Overview 
## Purpose
At a hypothetical automobile company the newest car, MechaCar, is in production, but recent production troubles are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. Production data on MechaCar is available for [miles per gallon test results of 50 prototypes](Resources/MechaCar_mpg.csv) and [weight capacities of multiple suspension coils from multiple production lots](Resources/Suspension_Coil.csv). The goal of this project was to review production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team using R, a programing language used for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing. An analysis roadmap for this project is provided below.
## Analysis Roadmap
The production data was import and read into R dataframes. Then, the **tidyverse** package containing the **dplry**, **tidyr**, and **ggplot2** was used throughout the analysis to transform, group, reshape, and visualize plots of the data. Fianlly, the R built-in **stats** was used to gather statistical calculations and perform hypothesis testing. The analysis was broken down into following four main parts:

1. **Linear Regression to Predict MPG**
  A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify which variables in the dataset predict the miles per gallon(mpg) of MechaCar prototypes.
2. **Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils**
  Summary statistics were collected on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
3. **T-Tests on Suspension Coils**
  T-tests were performed to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
4. **Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition**
  A statistical study was designed quantifying vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

A summary and results from the four parts are found under the corresponding subheading in the "Analysis" section.
