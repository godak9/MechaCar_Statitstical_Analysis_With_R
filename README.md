# MechaCar_Statitstical_Analysis_With_R
# Overview 
## Purpose
At a hypothetical automobile company the newest car, MechaCar, is in production, but recent production troubles are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. Production data on MechaCar is available for [miles per gallon test results of 50 prototypes](Resources/MechaCar_mpg.csv) and [weight capacities of multiple suspension coils from multiple production lots](Resources/Suspension_Coil.csv). The goal of this project was to review production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team using R, a programing language used for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing. An analysis roadmap for this project is provided below.
## Analysis Roadmap
First, the production data was imported and read into R dataframes. Then, R built-in **stats** was used to gather statistical calculations and perform hypothesis testing. The the **tidyverse** package containing the **dplry** library was also imported and used in the third part of the analysis group data. The analysis was broken down into following four main parts:

1. **Linear Regression to Predict MPG**
  A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify which variables in the dataset predict the miles per gallon(mpg) variable of MechaCar   prototypes.
2. **Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils**
  Summary statistics were collected on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
3. **T-Tests on Suspension Coils**
  T-tests were performed to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
4. **Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition**
  A statistical study was designed quantifying vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

A summary and results from the four parts are found under the corresponding subheading in the "Analysis" section.
# Analysis 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The **lm() function** from the built-in R **stats** package can be used to perfrom linear regression on data to predict a continuous dependent variable based on an independent variable. In this analysis, the data used was from a file containing [miles per gallon test results of 50 prototypes](Resources/MechaCar_mpg.csv). This data was loaded into an R dataframe named **MechaCar_mpg**. Then multiple linear regression was performed with five independent variables to identify which of these variables could predict the dependent variable **mpg** (miles per gallon). The five independent variables used were **vehicle_length**, **vehicle_weight**, **spoiler_angle**, **ground_clearance**, and **AWD** (drive train). Therefore, to generate a linear regression model the following statement was used in R:
```
lm(formula = mpg~ vehicle_length + cehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD, data=MechaCar_mpg)
```
The output of this statement was the coefficients for each variable in the equation:

These coefficients were used to create the linear regression model for the dataset: 
**__mpg= 6.27(vehicle_length) + 0.00126(vehicle_weight) + 0.0688(spoiler_angle) + 3.55(ground_clearance) - 3.41(AWD) - 104

The summary statistics were then generated by using the **summary() function** on the model. The output was as follows:

This model produced an r-squared value of 0.7149 meaning that about 71.5% of variability in mpg can be explained by the model.
The null hypothesis of a linear regression model proposes that the slope of the linear model is zero meaning dependent values are determined by random chance. The p-value generated from this model was 5.35e-11. If the signficance level was set at the stanadrad 0.05 this p-value was far lesser than the significance level, so the null hypothesis was sefely rejected.

The summary statistics output included a **Pr(|t|)** for each varaible. This value represents the probability that each coeffcient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. According to the results, **vehicle_weight** and **ground_clearance** have a significant impact on **mpg**, so they are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. 

An r-squared value of 0.7 or greater shows a generally high level of correlation between variables. Based on this model's r-squared value, I believe it could do an above-average job when it comes to predicting miles per gallon MechaCar prototypes effectively. The **Intercept** was also shown to be statistically significant. Log transfoming **vehicle_weight** and **ground_clearance** varaibles in the model caused a slight decrease in the r-squared, so  I believe there are other varaibles that can be included to bring th r-squared value closer to 1 and improve the predictive power of the model.
